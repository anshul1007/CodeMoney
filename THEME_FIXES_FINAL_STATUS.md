- **Custom Class Removal**: Eliminated all remaining custom classes (`.card`, `.financial-gradient`)
- **Inline Styling**: Replaced problematic custom classes with inline styles where needed
- **Tailwind Compliance**: Ensured all components use explicit Tailwind utilities

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/app/components/theme-showcase.component.html`** - Complete overhaul of all broken sections
2. **`src/app/components/welcome.component.html`** - Fixed button consistency and custom classes
3. **`src/styles.css`** - Added comprehensive animation keyframes and utility classes

### Key Strategies Used:
1. **Explicit Tailwind Classes**: Replaced all custom button/card classes with explicit utilities
2. **Inline Styling**: Used for gradients and complex color schemes that don't map to Tailwind
3. **Animation Architecture**: Built custom keyframes with Tailwind-compatible utility classes
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensured all components work across mobile, tablet, and desktop
5. **Performance**: Optimized animations with proper easing and duration settings
